Inventory Management Software Backend

This is a software basically used for large scale industries for inventory or stock management of their stores.
I have made admin panel for an admin to have eye on every transactions that is going in his stores i.e In and Out of the Materials or Products.</br>

- I have used PostgreSQL as an database and implemented relational database management concepts in this project.</br>
- I have used Postman to working of my REST API.</br>
- In Login and Registration module i have used Spring Security and JWT Token Authentication. Used Spring Data JPA Hibernate for accessing data and implemented custom
queries i.e. Native Queries and Spring Data JPA Queries.
- For sending confirmation email i have used Java inbuilt JavaMailSender and MimeMessage for creating a mail.
- In master module i have inserted company, location, product etc. entities in database and implemented JPARepository for it.
- Used the concepts of DBMS Pagination and Sorting for product registers and for that i again implemeted JPARepository for it.
- For Login verification i have used WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class and for password encryption i have used BCryptPasswordEncoder class.
